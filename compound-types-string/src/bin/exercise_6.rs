                       // fn add(self, s: &str) -> String;
                       // This method takes ownership of self, because in the case of String it is necessary in order to be able to modify self. This means we can't use s1 after the addition. At the same time, the add function
                       // takes a reference to a string slice for the second parameter, which is why we use &s2.
